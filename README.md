# CodeSys-SFC-to-Cpp-converter

## Goal
Create an easy to use converter to create a c++ code based on a SFC diagram.
Probably it could be compatible with all software which export diagrams in PLCopenXML standard, altough it tested only on CodeSys and the converter will be based on it.

## How to use
Drag and drop your ".xml" file on the executable and get your ".cpp" and ".hpp" files into the "out" folder.

## Os support
### Windows
I personally code and test the software on windows 10 and CodeSys only exists for Windows.
### Linux
Sometimes I put the code on an Arch VM to try compiling and testing, but I'm not so experienced.
### MacOs
Being coded in c++ it can be copiled for MacOs, but I don't have the knoweldge to do that.
If you want you can help me.

## Download
You need to go under [release](https://github.com/Fantazzj/CodeSys-SFC-to-Cpp-converter/releases) and get the newest.
Now there isn't any because I haven't already tested the output code. It will be done before the end of February
